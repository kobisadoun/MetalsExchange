The application i wrote is use to give the user the current prices of the precious metals Gold Silver Platinum and Palladium
The source of the data is from a web site that shows the information for the last 10 rates, Iâ€™m using JSoup library to parse the data.

My application using Sync Adapter will check this site and fetch the updated currencies and store them in the local SQlite Database.
In case new rates are available the application will generate a notification to the user.

The main activity show a list of rates with the latest rate in the first row with dedicated view.
Also we use Sliding Tab Layout that I get from the web, to show list of rates per Metal.

The detail view per rate will show the rates(the default currency and all the other currencies that the App supports ) for this date and also I show a trend graph
Using the MPAndroidChart library.
